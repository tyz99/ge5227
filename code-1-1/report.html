    <h1><b>GE5227 Project Report G5</b></h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    The United States of America is a diverse country with a complex demographic makeup. The population is characterized by a variety of factors, including age, sex, race, and income. These factors are interconnected and play a crucial role in shaping individual and societal outcomes, including access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. <br> According to the latest estimates, the U.S. has a population of over 331 million people, with a median age of 38.5 years. The country is almost evenly split between males and females, with women comprising slightly over 50% of the population. In terms of race, the U.S. is a melting pot, with a diverse mix of ethnic and racial groups. Non-Hispanic whites make up the largest racial group at 60.1%, followed by Hispanics at 18.5%, African Americans at 12.4%, and Asians at 5.9%. In terms of income, the U.S. is characterized by significant inequality, with the median household income estimated at $68,703 in 2020. However, income disparities are particularly pronounced across different demographic groups, with some groups experiencing significantly lower levels of income than others. Understanding the interplay between these demographic variables is crucial for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding the complexities of American society. In this piece, we will delve into the interplay between age, sex, race, and income in the United States, exploring how they influence each other and impact various aspects of life in America. <br> In this piece, we will explore the relationship between age, sex, race, and income in the spatial distribution of the United States, examining how patterns of segregation and clustering impact various aspects of life for different demographic groups across the country. By delving into the spatial dynamics of demographic variables, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex social and economic forces at play in American society.
    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
    Literature reivew is conducted on three aspects of the project topic. They are the demographic status quo and recent trends in the the US, the theories regarding the relationship between the variables, and visualization techiniques for building the web application.

    <h2>Project Aim</h2>
    In this project, an interactive exploratory web application is build to visualize the spatial distribution of different demographics in Florida, United States. The application will include three interactive maps: age and sex, income and race, alongside with a comprehensive dashboard presenting the summary statistics of the selected area for examination. Through which, the geographical distribution patterns of different demographics will be assessed. The underlying relationships between the variables will be analyzed.
